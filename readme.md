# Onix 

Onix is a lightweight configuration management database (CMDB) designed to support [Infrastructure as a Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) provisioning to ultimately provide a [single source of thruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) across [multi-cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicloud) environments.

The key features are:
- accessible via a [RESTful Web API](./docs/wapi.md), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) compoments ([Connectors](./connectors/readme.md)). A user interface is coming soon. :smiley:
- flexible customisation via [Models](./models/readme.md)  
- fully containerised, runs natively on Openshift and Kubernetes
- automatic population to avoid data misalignments, via Feeders is planned for a near future release.
