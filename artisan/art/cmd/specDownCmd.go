Use this command to download a specification (package export tarball files) from a remote URI to a file system folder 
but does not actually perform the import.
This is useful when files have to be inspected or transferred before the can be imported.

Example:
   # download a specification from a remote location
   art spec down s3s://my-s3-service.com/my-app/v1.0 -c S3_ID:S3_SECRET -p ./my-local-folder
 
   # perform some file validation / scan of downloaded assets
   scan [DEVICE]

   # import the specification from the local folder 
   art spec import ./my-local-folder
