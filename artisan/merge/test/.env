# This is the sample environment variable file used to merge sample 1 and 2 templates

# the following is an ordinary variable, you can define as many as you need

TITLE=Example of merging Grouped Variables

# the following is a set of variables to capture information required to merge port data
# define a PORT group containing name, description and value respectively
# NOTE 1: in this particular case there are 3 ports (i.e. sets of grouped variables)
#   any number of sets can be defined in this file and will be automatically picked by the artisan template
#   any number of variables within a set can be defined and will be automatically picked by the artisan template
# NOTE 2: artisan uses a naming convention to detect grouped variables
#   the format of the variable name is: GROUP-NAME__VARIABLE-NAME__VARIABLE-INDEX
#   check the naming below so it makes sense
PORT__NAME__1=Standard TCP
PORT__DESC__1=The standard port
PORT__VALUE__1=80

PORT__NAME__2=Alternative TCP
PORT__DESC__2=An alternative http port
PORT__VALUE__2=8080

PORT__NAME__3=Standard Encrypted
PORT__DESC__3=HTTPS port
PORT__VALUE__3=443

# say we also need to define URIs
# we then create URI group variables containing name and value as follows
# note in this particular case there are 2 different URIs (i.e. sets of grouped variables)
# as above, any number of sets can be defined in this file and will be automatically picked by the artisan template
URI__NAME__1=URI 1
URI__VALUE__1=www.hhhh.com

URI__NAME__2=URI 2
URI__VALUE__2=www.hhwedwdehh.com
