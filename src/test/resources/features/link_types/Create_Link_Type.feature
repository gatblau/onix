Feature: Create a new Link Type
  As an API user
  I want to create a new Link Type
  So that link instances can be associated to the link type

  Scenario: Create a new Link Type
    Given a model exists in the database
    Given the link type does not exist in the database
    Given the link type URL of the service with key is known
    Given the link type natural key is known
    When a link type PUT HTTP request with a JSON payload is done
    Then the response code is 201
    Then the response has body
    Then the result contains no errors
