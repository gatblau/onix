# Onix Provider <img src="../../docs/pics/ox.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">

The Terraform provider for Onix allows Terraform to manage configuration information in the Onix Config Manager as Terraform [resources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html) and [data sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/data-sources.html).

## Connection information ([up](#toc))

Connection information can be provided by specifying the following attributes of the ox provider as follows:

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| __uri__| The URI of the Onix Web API | http://localhost:8080 |
| __auth_mode__ | Defines the method used by the provider to authenticate with the Onix Web API. If not specified, it defaults to __basic__ (basic authentication). Other possible value as __none__ or __oidc__ (OpenId Connect). | basic |
| __client_id__ | The public identifier for the Onix Web API defined by the OAUth 2.0 server. It is only required if _auth_mode_ is set to _oidc_. | 2Idlxf0ryAGOd3gaj938 |
| __secret__ | A secret known only to the application and the authorisation server. It is only required if _auth_mode_ is set to _oidc_. | Hl5_V_lbhLQHol47f5is6YErs7pHKP3OP3oEf7H3 |
| __token_uri__ | The OAuth 2.0 server endpoint where the ox provider exchanges the user credentials, client ID and client secret, for an access token. It is only required if _auth_mode_ is set to _oidc_. | https://dev-1234.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token |
 | __user__ | A unique sequence of characters used to identify a user of the Onix Web API. A typical value could be the user email address defined in the OAuth Server. | user@email.com |
 | __pwd__ | A secret word supplied by the user in order to gain access to the Onix Web API. | 0n1x_440d4f6f |
  
__NOTE__: The __auth_mode__ attribute must match the value used by the Onix Web API. For example, if the Onix Web API is set to use __auth_mode=oidc__ then the terraform provider must be set to use the same __auth_mode__, otherwise the authentication will fail.

Below are examples of setting the provider to use different authentication modes.

__*Basic Authentication Example*__

In order to authenticate using [Basic Access Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), there is no need to specify the __auth_mode__ attribute. Only _user_ and _pwd_ are required:

```hcl-terraform
# Basic Authentication
provider "ox" {
  uri       = "http://localhost:8080"
  auth_mode = "basic" # default value if no specified
  user      = "user-name-here"
  pwd       = "user-password-here"
}
```

__*OpenId / OAuth 2.0 Authentication Example*__

If [OpenId Connect / OAuth 2.0](https://openid.net/connect/) is selected as the authentication method, then in addition to the _user_ and _pwd_ attributes, _client_id_ and _secret_ and _token_uri_ are also required:

```hcl-terraform
# OpenId Authentication
provider "ox" {
  uri       = "http://localhost:8080"
  auth_mode = "oidc"
  user      = "user-name-here"
  pwd       = "user-password-here"
  client_id = "application-client-id-here"
  secret    = "application-secret-here"
  token_uri = "uri-of-the-token-endpoint-at-authorisation-server"
}
```

__*No Authentication Example*__


```hcl-terraform
# No Authentication
provider "ox" {
  uri       = "http://localhost:8080"
  auth_mode = "none"
  user      = ""
  pwd       = ""
}
```

__Note__: user & pwd attributes need to be specified but its value is not used if _auth_mode_ is set to _none_.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation ([up](#toc))

In order to use this provider, it must be manually installed, since terraform init cannot automatically download it.

Install the provider by placing its plugin executable in the user plugins directory. 
The user plugins directory is in one of the following locations, depending on the host operating system:

|Operating system|	User plugins directory|
|---|---|
|Windows	| %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins|
|All other systems|	~/.terraform.d/plugins|

Alternatevely, the provider can also be placed under the local folder where Terraform is run from. 

For example: **working_directory/.terraform.d/plugins**

Once the plugin is placed in the correct location, the [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) command has to be run to initialise the working directory ready for use.

<a name="resources"></a>
## Resources ([up](#toc))

Resources are the most important element in the Terraform language. Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as compute instances, higher-level components such as DNS records or in this case, end points in the [Onix Web API](../docs/wapi.md).

The Onix Provider for Terraform, acts as a Restful client allowing to perform requests to the Onix Web API.

The list of resources offered in this provider is as follows:

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [ox_model](./docs/rs_ox_model.md) | Creates, updates or deletes a [modelKey](../docs/models/readme.md). |
| [ox_item](./docs/rs_ox_item.md) | Creates, updates or deletes a configuration item. |
| [ox_item_type](./docs/rs_ox_item_type.md) | Creates, updates or deletes a configuration item type. |
| [ox_link](./docs/rs_ox_link.md) | Creates, updates or deletes a configuration item link. |
| [ox_link_type](./docs/rs_ox_link_type.md) | Creates, updates or deletes a configuration item link type. |
| [ox_link_rule](./docs/rs_ox_link_rule.md) | Creates, updates or deletes a configuration item link rule. |

## Data Sources ([up](#toc))

Data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terraform configuration. 

This provider does not currently support data sources.
